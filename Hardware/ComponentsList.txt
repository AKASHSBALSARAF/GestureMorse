Component List

1)Arduino Uno (1x)
Microcontroller to process input signals and control the system.

2)10k Ohm Potentiometers (3x)
Used to detect finger movements for Morse code input (dots, dashes, and spaces).

3)NRF24L01 Wireless Module (2x)
For wireless communication between the transmitter and receiver.

4)Jumper Wires (Multiple)
For connecting the potentiometers, NRF24L01, and other components to the Arduino.

5)Breadboard (1x)
For easy prototyping and connecting components during testing.

6)Power Supply (Battery or USB)
5V power supply (can be from a battery pack or USB connection).

7)Glove (1x)
A regular glove to mount the potentiometers for detecting finger movements.

8)Resistors (1k Ohm) (Optional)
Resistors can be added to the potentiometer circuits for more stable readings.

9)OLED Display (Optional)
For displaying the received Morse code (if you want to add a visual display).

10)Push Button (Optional)
Additional input for controlling other aspects of the system (e.g., resetting input).
